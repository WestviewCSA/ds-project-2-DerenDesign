TODO after reading:

1. Understand map-based input files
2. Implement map based first then coordinated based
3. Generate Test Cases in terms of maps 5 for each
4. Set command line arguements --> booleans that help track what my program will run
5  Confirm readability of each map
6. Create 3 different methods for Queue, ShortestPath, and Stack
7. Implement the stack solution first (need to update Tile and Map for appropriate needs)
8. Implemenmt the queue solution
9. Implement ShortestPath
10. Implement runtime calculations
10. Have a way to get rid of extraneous characters outside the map
11. write exceptions and acccount for specific errors --> from doc: " In the text-map format, you should check for:
illegal characters
maps that are incomplete (not enough characters/line or not enough lines)
files that don't start with a pair of positive numbers as the first line
In the coordinate-based format, you should check for:
illegal characters in the first column
coordinates that don't fit inside the maze
files that don't start with a pair of positive numbers as the first line
Not having exactly one of --Stack, --Queue, or --Opt switches set
In all cases, throw the appropriate exception described in the Exceptions section. "
12. Debug along the way usign syso statements and I will make sure functionality works on one part before moving on
